Hi Guys,
Some rules for GIT commit.
1) No one will commit directly on the master branch.
2) Please push your code on the local branch of your own. (I will guide how to do it.)
3) Plese do the cloning now and then. (its prefered to do cloning after every Push.) This will make sure you have latest version of Codes. We need to do this because along with you our teammates will also be pushing there codes, which can cause conflict in the master branch at time of pull request. And this is also the reason we are not allowed to push code to master branch.
4) Rest we will discuss in the team meeting.
